# TR0005: InvalidMemberName

## Cause
The processed Resx-file contains a key that, when being reduce, ends up being non-compilable

## Rule description

During code generation, resource-keys are sanitized to remove obviously incompatible characters. However, there are certain scenarios where this does not suffice, f.e. when the reduced name solely consists of reserved keywords or similar.

When such an incompatible name is detected, TypealizR tries to resolve to a compilable name and generates this warning.

## How to fix violations
Modify the resource-key to not violate naming-rules after it has been reduced.

## When to suppress warnings
If youÂ´re ok with the fallback value generated by TypealizR ;)

## Example of a violation

### Description
The following content of a Resx-file demonstrate, what keys produce this warning. 
### Code

```xml
<root>
  <data name="class" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hello.</value>
  </data>
</root>
```

## Example of how to fix

### Description
In order to fix this particular situation, just prepend the key with an `_`.
### Code

```xml
<root>
  <data name="_class" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hello</value>
  </data>
</root>
```

or similar ;)
